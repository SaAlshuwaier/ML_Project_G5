Motivation & Problem Statement

Many car owners forget or delay regular maintenance because there’s no clear reminder or tracking system.  
This often leads to:
- Unexpected car breakdowns  
- Increased repair costs  
- Reduced vehicle lifespan  

Our project aims to (simplify and automate vehicle maintenance tracking) by using data-driven insights.  
By analyzing maintenance history, vehicle conditions, and environmental factors, we can predict when maintenance is needed and help users stay proactive rather than reactive.

About the Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about vehicles, including:
- Maintenance records
- Vehicle attributes 
- Environmental conditions  
  

This data helps us:
1. Identify patterns in maintenance behavior.  
2. Predict when a vehicle might need servicing.  
3. Build a recommendation or alert system for upcoming maintenance.
